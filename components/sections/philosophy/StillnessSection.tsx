      translation="When the heart is still, the mind can focus — and with focus, all things are possible."
      description="At Da Di, we begin each lesson with 15 minutes of mindfulness practice — a sacred pause for breathing, reflection, and emotional reset. This practice of 静 (Stillness) is not just about being quiet; it's about cultivating presence and awareness. Students learn to center themselves, developing focus that carries through their language learning journey. These mindful moments help our learners become not just better speakers — but better people: calm, resilient, and ready to connect deeply with others."
